## Vision: 
For FIT3140, a financial institution who is looking for a dedicated reactive measure to handle on-site emergency events (robbery cases), the emergency response system being built would alert the response staff of on-site emergencies for response when the button was pressed by ground staff in a designated way.

## Project Description: 
For the emergency response system, a button which connected to a client board, would be placed within the FIT3140 building. The ground staff would be trained to press the button in designated way to alert the response staff. The button has the Internet capabilities to send signals over to the response staff. The response staff would perform certain action, such as activating the premise alarm or lock the premise safes, depends on the signal received.
